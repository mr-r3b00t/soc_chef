EDR tools enable precise isolation, restricting both ingress (threat actor control) and egress (data exfiltration). Disabling network interfaces and using a quarantine VLAN ensure no communication occurs, while logs support forensics.</p>
                                <p class="mt-2 text-gray-700"><strong>Scope:</strong> Isolation is limited to the infected device, with no broader network impact needed.</p>
